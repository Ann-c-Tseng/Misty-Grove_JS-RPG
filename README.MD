<h1> Misty Grove: JavaScript RPG </h1>

## Project Summary:
This is an RPG game I created coding along to Drew Conley's Pizza Legends JavaScript Development coding series to challenge myself in game development using traditional front-end tech stack. Here is the link to Drew's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@DrewConley

This project's game story is not yet finished, but functionalities such as the following are all implemented:
* character movement controlled by WASD or Arrowkeys
* NPC movement and text speech
* Cutscenes and map transitions
* Magical acquirement and character healing properties
* Battle mode + full battle functionalities: hp loss/gain, attack animations, battle-character switches

## Tools Used:
JavaScript for the majority of game mechanics, HTML, CSS, https://www.pixilart.com/ for pixel art and background creation
